# HTML5 FormData

Emulate *FormData* object for browsers wich support [FileAPI](http://www.w3.org/TR/FileAPI/) interface.

*formdata.js* doesn't overload original *FormData* object in browser like Safari 5.0+, Firefox 4.0+ or Chrome 6.0+.

## About FormData

FormData objects provide a way to easily construct a set of key/value pairs representing form fields and their values, which can then be easily sent using the XMLHttpRequest send() method.

[developer.mozilla.org/en/XMLHttpRequest/FormData](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/XMLHttpRequest/FormData)

## How to use it ?

Include *formdata.js*:

    <script type="text/javascript" src="formdata.js"></script>

And use xmlhttprequest with some bad adjustments.

    var data = new FormData();
    data.append('file', document.getElementById('file').files[0]);

    xhr.open('POST', '/', true);
    xhr.setRequestHeader("Cache-Control", "no-cache");
    xhr.setRequestHeader("X-Requested-With", "XMLHttpRequest");
    // this is really bad
    if (data.fake) {
       xhr.setRequestHeader("Content-Type", "multipart/form-data; boundary="+ data.boundary);
       xhr.sendAsBinary(data.toString());
    } else {
       xhr.send(data);
    }

### With jquery.form.js

jquery.form.js have been patched and can use fake FormData. See [github.com/AF83/form](https://github.com/AF83/form).
